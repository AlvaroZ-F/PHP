A bunch of text that you should probably not read cause it hurts my eyes to have been studying for so damn long and I not longer know what I am doing.
I really wish I could simply take a break but instead, I'm studying past midnight, neglecting sleep.
Cause that's what students do.
For absolutely nothing.
